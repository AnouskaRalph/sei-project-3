# The Montréal Project - GA Project Three

### Goal and timeframe 

- The third project was a group one, we had 8days to create a fully functioning 

### Technologies Used
- React
- Express API
- Node.js
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- Axios
- SASS
- Semantic UI React 

### Process

We created a web application that allowed residents of Montréal to share and find their favourite activities and local spots. It was a full-stack application, with an Express API using MongoDB and React on the front-end. We utilised wireframes on Figma to guide the MVP and Trello for managing progress. As a team of four, we split the tasks, sometimes working individually and sometimes pair coding.

- Working on a group project creating a wireframe was really important to make sure we were all working to the same goal. 
- Communication was key in building this app to we spent a lot of time building the wireframe and logic flow of the site. 
- We started off with all four of us getting the basics up and running; backend and frontend basic funtionality and then we broke off into pairs to work on different aspects of   the site. 

- I worked on the frontend building out the landing page, login and register components. 


### Challenges 
- Error handling 
- Working across multiple components
- Using a styling framework 

### Reflection 
- This was great project to work on in terms of working with a larger team. Working together gave me an insight into how other people work through coding problems.
