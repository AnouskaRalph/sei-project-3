# The Montréal Project - GA Project Three

The Montréal Project is a MERN stack app designed for local people to share their experiences and favorite destinations in and around Montréal. Users can either browse from a wide range of activites and can add their own attractions once signed up, allowing them to also comment and rate other users postings. The aim was to build a fun and interactive site for Montréal dwellers.

### Goal and timeframe 

- This was a four person group project, we had 8days to create a fully functioning application.

### Technologies Used
- React.js
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Semantic UI React
- Axios
- React Mapbox GL
- Nodemon
- HTTP-proxy-middleware
- Bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken
- Git, and GitHub

### Process

- We utilised wireframes on Figma to guide the MVP and Trello for managing progress. As a team of four, we split the tasks, sometimes working individually and sometimes pair coding.
- Working on a group project creating a wireframe was really important to make sure we were all working to the same goal.

- Communication was key in building this app to we spent a lot of time building the wireframe and logic flow of the site. 
- We started off with all four of us getting the basics up and running; backend and frontend basic funtionality and then we broke off into pairs to work on different aspects of   the site. 
- I worked on the frontend building out the landing page, login and register components.

### Challenges 
- Error handling 
- Working across multiple components
- Using a styling framework 

### Reflection 
- This was great project to work on in terms of working with a larger team. Working together gave me an insight into how other people work through coding problems.
